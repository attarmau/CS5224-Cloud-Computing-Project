# You are given a SELECT statement showing customer names and orders. Customer names can repeat for multiple orders. How can you change the query to return a list of customers who ordered at least once?
SELECT DISTINCT customer_name

# What can you add to your table definition to ensure that only records with a tolerance value within that range can be added to the table?
CREATE TABLE your_table_name (
  -- other column definitions
  
  tolerance_level DECIMAL(3, 1) CHECK (tolerance_level >= 2.0 AND tolerance_level <= 5.1),
