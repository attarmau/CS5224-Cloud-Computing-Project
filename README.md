# CS5224 Cloud Computing Project
This project aims to provide a useful tool for AWS users to ensure that their security groups are properly configured and that no sensitive services are exposed to the public internet by scanning an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account for open security groups using Python and the AWS SDK (Boto3).
